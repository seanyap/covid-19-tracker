Process that I took to build this app

1. Create a visual wireframe of the app 

2. Create React app

3. Clean up the starter code

4. Build the components mockup and pass in example data placeholder
    - Style the code with CSS
    - Use UI library like Material-UI

5. Pull in data from APIs to populate the placeholder in the components
    - Understanding which API endpoints to use
    - Pull in data using fetch() and process the response to .json()
    - Test the data by console logging it
    - Notice the KEYS in the object
