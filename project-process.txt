Process that I took to build this app

1. Create a visual wireframe of the app (using draw.io)

2. Create React app

3. Clean up the starter code

3. Research for libraries to use
    - Material-UI for user interface
    - Leaflet for map
    - React Chart.js for graph 
    - numeral for numbers formatting

4. Build the components mockup and render with example data placeholder (structure)
    - Use UI library like Material-UI
    - Style the component with CSS

5. Create Header

6. Create Info Boxes 

7. Create Table

8. Create Chart 

9. Create Map

5. Pull in data from APIs to populate the placeholder in the components
    - Understanding which API endpoints to use
    - Pull in data using fetch() and process the response to .json()
    - Test the data by console logging it
    - Notice the KEYS in the object
